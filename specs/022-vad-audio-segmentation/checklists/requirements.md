# Specification Quality Checklist: Dynamic VAD-Based Audio Segmentation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-06
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. The specification is complete and ready for planning phase (`/speckit.plan`) or clarification phase (`/speckit.clarify`) if additional requirements emerge.

**Validation Summary**:
- 6 user stories defined with priorities (P1, P2)
- 30 functional requirements organized by category
- 10 success criteria with measurable metrics
- 10 assumptions documented
- Comprehensive edge case analysis
- All requirements testable and technology-agnostic
- No clarification markers needed (all requirements are well-defined with reasonable defaults)
